      <description>(Last updated: June 10, 2021)
Over the course of this summer, I intend to read many papers related to quantum computing and federated learning. So far, most of my blog posts have been about articles and tutorials published online. However in the next few days, I hope to share a few posts about peer-reviewed papers. These are generally more complicated to read through and understand, and they are hard to write about.</description>
