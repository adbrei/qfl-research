In my last post, I summarized &amp;ldquo;How to Read a Paper&amp;rdquo;1 with the Three-Pass method. Now, I would like to apply this algorithm to one paper especially significant to my research: “TensorFlow Quantum: A Software Framework for Quantum Machine Learning.”2. In this post, I perform the first pass. This paper is worth a second pass, since it is directly relevant to my research.
 Review of First Pass (from previous post) Without reading details or illustrations, get a general understanding of the paper&amp;rsquo;s topic and how it will approach the topic.</description>

Over the course of this summer, I intend to read many papers related to quantum computing and federated learning. So far, most of my blog posts have been about articles and tutorials published online. However in the next few days, I hope to share a few posts about peer-reviewed papers. These are generally more complicated to read through and understand, and they are hard to write about.</description>
