Over the course of this summer, I intend to read many papers related to quantum computing and federated learning. So far, most of my blog posts have been about articles and tutorials published online. However in the next few days, I hope to share a few posts about peer-reviewed papers. These are generally more complicated to read through and understand, and they are hard to write about.</description>

So far, the majority of my blog posts concentrate on aspects of Quantum Computing. Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to shift gears to the other side of my research: Federated Learning (FL). My goal is to glean a better intuitive understanding of the mathematical equations that represent the FL framework. I start with Saheed Tijani&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Federated Learning: Why, What and How&amp;rdquo; that was posted on LinkedIn on 14 April 2020.</description>
